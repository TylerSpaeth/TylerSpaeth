## Interesting things I have worked on:
[Sprocket](https://github.com/TylerSpaeth/Sprocket)
- A framework for creating 2D games and applications developed in C++ with OpenGL as the rendering API.
- This is a project I have been working on to get a better understanding of how things like Unreal Engine and Unity work under the hood.
- This project has been a great learning experience.
  - It has required careful consideration how I lay out the architecture, as I've had to deal with the good and bad consequences of those decisions as the project has grown.
  - I have had to prioritize performance much more than in anything else I have worked on.
  - Physics/Collision detection has been a major focus for optimization and has exposed me to a number of different approaches to handling the problem.

[FishingApp](https://github.com/TylerSpaeth/FishingApp)
- A tool for people who fly fish that allows them to track their catches and view metrics regarding their success.
- This was built both for my interest in fly fishing and to explore certain technologies.
  - I was able to look into JavaFX further than the surface level information that I acquired from coursework.
  - I learned the basics of incorporating a database with SQLite, which provided me with a good segway to learning PostgreSQL.
  
[FinanceTracker](https://github.com/TylerSpaeth/FinanceTracker)
- A website that allows users to track their finances and summarizes the total over different time frames.
- This is currently hosted live at [https://financetracker.software](https://financetracker.software).
- I worked on this project in order to gain exposure to full stack web development.
- Over the course of the project I learned a number of things including:
  - .Net Minimal APIs
  - PostgreSQL
  - Apache Web Servers
  - Reverse Proxies
  - And much more
